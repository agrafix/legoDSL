Haskell LegoDSL

## DSL

You can write Haskell-code and generate nxc-code for the nbc compiler. Examples are in Example.hs and ExampleCode.hs

## VM

You can test your Haskell-code using a VM. Example is in ExampleVM.hs

## Scripting

You can also script your NXT using a JavaScript-like language. Example is lineFollow.js. Use the Compiler to generate nxc-code and then the nbc compiler to transfer it to your robot.
